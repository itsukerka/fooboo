jQMultiTouch
============

## The jQuery of Multi-touch

jQMultiTouch is a lightweight toolkit and development framework for multi-touch web interface development. Not only is it similar to jQuery in terms of the idea of providing a lightweight and general framework, but also because of the fact that it adopts many key ideas from jQuery and applies them to the framework's core concepts.
The main ideas behind jQMultiTouch and its core features are described [in this paper](http://www.globis.ethz.ch/publications/?action=show_abstract&pubid=346) presented at the [EICS 2012](http://eics-conference.org/2012) conference.

jQMultiTouch was originally created in the [Global Information Systems Group](http://www.globis.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich. It is written and maintained by [Michael Nebeling](http://www.michael-nebeling.de). It also contains contributions from Saiganesh Swaminathan, Maximilian Speicher, Martin Grubinger, Maria Husmann and Yassin Hassan. It is available as free open-source software distributed under the GPLv3 license. See the file [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.

## Features
				
* **Support for Firefox and WebKit Browsers**:  One of the core features of jQMultiTouch is that it supports Firefox and WebKit-based browsers such as Safari. As a result, cross-browser compatibilty issues between different touch event models and data are resolved and touch events can be handled in a uniform way independent of browser-specific implementations.
* **Default Multi-Touch Gesture Handlers**:  jQMultiTouch provides support for custom touch and gesture handlers, but also offers default implementations to enable common dragging, scaling and rotation operations in supported browsers.
* **Touch History Query and Evaluation Mechanisms**:  One of the core components of jQMultiTouch is the touch event buffer or history. The touch history keeps a record of current and previous touches, and can be filtered by all touch-related properties, e.g. touch id (i.e. finger), touch event, target element and timestamp. This is important for gestures that may involve several fingers, a series of touch down, move and up events as well as multiple target elements within a certain period of time.
* **Gesture Templates**: To make working with the touch history easier for developers, jQMultiTouch provides several methods for querying and filtering the entries according to a combination of criteria. These can for example be used to detect simple swipe left/right gestures.
* **Touch Support**: jQMultiTouch also provides a cross-browser compatible method to find out whether touch events are supported by the device and browser in use.
* **Device Orientation**: In addition, jQMultiTouch provides a simple way of reacting to changes in the orientation of the device.

## Usage

jQMultiTouch needs to be included using the following statements:

```html
<!-- include jQuery (required) -->
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<!-- include jQMultiTouch core (required) -->
<script src="js/jquery.multitouch.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<!-- include jQMultiTouch attachable behaviours (optional) -->
<script src="js/jquery.multitouch-draggable.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="js/jquery.multitouch-scalable.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="js/jquery.multitouch-resizable.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="js/jquery.multitouch-rotatable.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<!-- include jQMultiTouch stylesheet (optional) -->
<link href="css/jquery.multitouch.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```

jQMultiTouch requires jQuery (compatible with versions 1.6.4 or higher) and the core (`js/jquery.multitouch.js`) to be included in the document. The attachable behaviours and the stylesheet are optional.

### `$.touch` Environment

jQMultiTouch's core defines the `$.touch` environment and with it the following features and options:

* `$.touch.preventDefault: boolean = true`: Can be set to globally control default browser behaviour (default is `true`, i.e. to prevent default behaviour).

* `$.touch.triggerMouseEvents: boolean = false`: Can be set to simulate touch events, e.g. for legacy support and testing on non-touch devices (default is `false`, i.e. to only react to touch events).

* `$.touch.enabled(): boolean`: Can be called to check whether touch is available on the device (returns `true`) or not (returns `false`).

* `$.touch.ready(function): boolean`: Can be called to register a function that will be executed when the DOM is ready, provided that touch is available (see `$.touch.enabled()`) or `$.touch.triggerMouseEvents` is set to `true`.

* `$.fn.touches: array of touch`: Returns all touches for the element, e.g.
```javascript
if ($(element).touches().length > 1) {
    // more than one finger is touching the element
}
```

Note that a touch object `touch` is defined as follows:

```javascript
touch = {
    // unique identifier for touch point
    id: int,
    // x position of touch point within document
    clientX: int,
    // y position of touch point within document
    clientY: int,
    // elementFromPoint(touch.clientX, touch.clientY)
    target: documentElement,
}
```

* `$.touch.allTouches: object`: Can be read to access all globally active touches (independent of their target elements), e.g.
```javascript
$.each($.touch.allTouches, function() {
    // log all elements that are currently being touched
    console.log(this.target)
})
```

* `$.touch.history: TouchHistory`: Maintains the global touch event buffer or history

* `$.touch.historyMaxSize: int = 64`: Sets the maximum size of the touch event buffer (default is 64)

* `$.touch.historyFilterPredicates: object`: Defines the predicates that can be used in `TouchHistory.filter()` and `TouchHistory.find()`, e.g. `type`, `target`, `touch`, `finger` and `time`

* `$.touch.historyMatchPredicates: object`: Defines the predicates that can be used in `TouchHistory.match()`, e.g. `clientX`, `clientY`, `deltaX`, `deltaY`, `netX` and `netY`

* `$.touch.noConflict(): boolean`: Can be used for conflict resolution of jQMultiTouch's `$.touch` environment

The `TouchHistory` object defines the following functions:

* `size(): int`: Can be called to read the size of the history

* `find(template): int`: Can be called to find the first touch event in the history that matches the criteria specified in template; returns -1 if not found.

* `get(index): touchEvent`: Can be called to get the `touchEvent` at the specified `index` in the history

Note that a touch event `touchEvent` is defined as follows:

```javascript
touchEvent = {
    // touch object that triggered the event
    touch: touch,
    // target element of touch event
    target: documentElement,
    // x position of touch point within document
    clientX: int,
    // y position of touch point within document
    clientY: int,
    // type of touch event: 'touchdown'|'touchmove'|'touchup'|'gesture'
    type: touchEventType,
    // timestamp when event was triggered
    time: $.now(),
}
```
* `first(): touchEvent`: Can be called to get the first `touchEvent` from the history.

* `last(): touchEvent`: Can be called to get the last `touchEvent` from the history.

* `start(template): TouchHistory`: Can be called to set the start of the history to the first `touchEvent` that matches the `template`, where `template` defines the following properties:

    * `template.type: touchEventType|array of touchEventType`: Constrains history to a single type or set of `touchdown`|`touchmove`|`touchup` events.
    * `template.target: documentElement|array of documentElement`: Constrains history to one or more DOM elements.
    * `template.touch: touch`: Constrains history to specified touch object, e.g. `$.touch.allTouches[0]` for the first touch object.
    * `template.finger: int|string`: Constrains history to touch events indexed within the specified range, e.g. `0` for the first finger that is touching the screen or `0..2` for the first three fingers.
    * `template.time: string`: Constrains history to a specified time window, e.g. `1..100` or `<=100` for a 100ms.
    * `template.clientX|clientY: string`: Returns true if every touch in the history is within the position constraints, e.g. `>550` or `100..150` for all touch points with coordinates greater than `550px` or between `100px` and `150px`
    * `template.deltaX|deltaY: string`: Returns true if the difference between the positions of the first and last touch event in the history is within the specified delta, e.g. `>100` or `+-10` for all touch points that have moved at least `100px` right/down and by `10px` left/right or up/down, respectively.
    * `template.netX|netY: string`: Returns true if the touch point has moved by the specified distance accumulated over the series of touch events in the history, e.g. `>100` for at least 100 pixels to the right

* `stop(template): TouchHistory`:  Can be called to set the end of the history to the last `touchEvent` that matches the `template`.

* `match(t): boolean`: Can be called to compare the history against the specified `template` and returns true if all criteria are matched. The history will first be filtered according to `$.touch.historyFilterPredicates` (also see `TouchHistory.filter`) and then evaluated using the `$.touch.historyMatchPredicates`. Note that the parameter `t` can be a single `template` or an `array` of templates in which case all templates are required to match.

* `filter(t): TouchHistory`: Can be called to filter the history by the specified `template` and returns the constrained history. Supported predicates are registered in `$.touch.historyFilterPredicates` and can specify single or multiple values in which case it is sufficient that one of the values matches. Note that the parameter `t` can be a single `template` or an `array` of templates in which case all templates will be applied as a filter.

* `query(select): TouchHistory`: Can be called to constrain the history according to a set of templates for segmentation, filter and match functions, where `select` defines the following properties:

    * `select.start: template = undefined`
    * `select.stop: template = undefined`
    * `select.filter: template = undefined`
    * `select.match: template = undefined`

* `each(function): TouchHistory`: Can be called to iterate over the history calling `function(touchEvent)` for each touch event.

* `empty(): TouchHistory`: Can be called to clear all touch events from the history by setting the size to `0`.

**Note that most methods of the `TouchHistory` object can be chained as they return a new `TouchHistory` object (i.e. `start`, `stop`,  `filter`, `query`, `each`, `empty`).**

See [jQMultiTouch core](js/jquery.multitouch.js) for details.

### Attachable Multi-touch Behaviours

The core multi-touch behaviour in jQMultiTouch is `touchable`.
In addition, jQMultiTouch implements four attachable multi-touch behaviours:

* [Draggable Behaviour](js/jquery.multitouch-draggable.js): Translate touchable elements using drag and drop gesture
* [Scalable Behaviour](js/jquery.multitouch-scalable.js): Zoom touchable elements using pinch gestures
* [Resizable Behaviour](js/jquery.multitouch-resizable.js): Change size of touchable elements using pinch gestures
* [Rotatable Behaviour](js/jquery.multitouch-rotatable.js): Rotate touchable elements

**Note that all `draggable`, `scalable`, `resizable` and `rotatable` elements automatically become `touchable` elements.**

**Also note that the `scalable` and `resizable` behaviour cannot be attached to the same element at the same time.**

Below you can find an example taken from the [Picture Viewing Application](examples/pictures.html). The script turns all images in a web page into `draggable`, `scalable` and `rotatable`elements.

```javascript
$(img)
  .draggable()
  .scalable({ minScale: 0.5, maxScale: 1.5 })
  .rotatable()
```

#### Touchable Behaviour

The `touchable` behaviour and its defaults are defined as follows:

```javascript
$.touch.touchable = {
    // locally enable/disable default browser behaviour
    preventDefault: boolean = true,
    // callback when a new touch is registered, return false to cancel default handler
    touchDown: function(touchEvent, touchHistory): boolean = function() { return true },
    // callback when touch is moving, return false to cancel default handler
    touchMove: function(touchEvent, touchHistory): boolean = function() { return true },
    // callback when touch is released, return false to cancel default handler
    touchUp: function(touchEvent, touchHistory): boolean = function() { return true },
    // custom gesture callback
    gesture: function(touchEvent, touchHistory): boolean = function() { return false },
    // register gesture template callbacks
    gestureCallbacks: array of { template: template, callback: function } = [],
    // default touchable handler, override for custom touchable behaviour
    touchableHandler: function(touchEvent, touchHistory),
}
```

The default `touchableHandler` adds the CSS class `touched` on `touchDown` and removes it on `touchUp`.

When the `gesture` event is triggered and the `gesture` callback does not return `false`, it will subsequently evaluate all templates registered under `gestureCallbacks` and, for each template, execute the callback defined for the template.

#### Draggable Behaviour

The `draggable` behaviour and its defaults are defined as follows:

```javascript
$.touch.draggable: {
    // perform dragging according to x/y grid by flooring target coordinates
    grid: [int, int] = [1, 1],			
    // set to true to constrain drag operation to parent
    constrainParent: boolean = false,
    // before dragging callback, return false to cancel default handler
    dragBefore: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    // during dragging callback, return false to cancel default handler
    dragDuring: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    // after dragging callback, return false to cancel default handler
    dragAfter: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    // default draggable handler, override for custom dragging behaviour
    draggableHandler: function(touchEvent, touchHistory)
}
```

#### Scalable Behaviour

The `scalable` behaviour and its defaults are defined as follows:

```javascript
$.touch.scalable = {
    minScale: int = false,
    maxScale: int = false,
    scaleBefore: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    scaleDuring: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    scaleAfter: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    scalableHandler: function(touchEvent, touchHistory),
}
```

#### Resizable Behaviour

The `resizable` behaviour and its defaults are defined as follows:

```javascript
$.touch.resizable = {
    minWidth: int = false,
    maxWidth: int = false,
    minHeight: int = false,
    maxHeight: int = false,
    resizeBefore: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    resizeDuring: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    resizeAfter: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    resizableHandler: function(touchEvent, touchHistory),
}
```

#### Rotatable Behaviour

The `rotatable` behaviour and its defaults are defined as follows:

```javascript
$.touch.rotatable = {
    // rotation steps in degrees, currently ignored
    step: int = 1,
    rotateBefore: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    rotateDuring: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    rotateAfter: function(touchEvent): boolean = function() { return true },
    rotatableHandler: function(touchEvent, touchHistory),
}
```

#### Orientable Behaviour

In addition, jQMultiTouch implements the [Orientable Behaviour](js/jquery.multitouch-orientable.js) as a simple way to react to changes in device orientation (or window portrait/landscape mode).

The `orientable` behaviour is implemented based on two functions extending jQMultiTouch's core:

* `$.touch.orientationChanged(function (orientation))`: Can be called to register a new orientation change handler, e.g.

    ```javascript
    $.touch.orientationChanged(function (orientation) {
        if (Math.abs(orientation) === 90) {
            alert('landscape')
        } else if (orientation === 0) {
            alert('portrait')
        }
    })
    ```

* `$.touch.orientationHandler: function()`: The default orientation handler, override for custom orientation behaviour

The default handler will automatically show/hide `orientable` elements marked with the following classes according to the orientation.

* `.portrait`: Only visible in portrait mode
* `.landscape`: Only visible in landscape mode (if device was rotated to the right)
* `.landscape-90`: Only visible in landscape mode (if device was rotated to the left)

See the [Orientation Demo](examples/orientation.html) for an example.

### Custom Gesture Handlers

```javascript
$.touch.ready(function() {
  $(element).touchable({
    // custom gesture handler
    gesture: function(e, th) {
      // segment touch history
      th.start({ type: 'touchup' }).stop({ type: 'touchdown' })
      // constrain touch history
      if (th.filter({ finger: 0, time: '<100' }).match({ deltaX: '<-100' })) {
        // swipe left detected
      }
    }
  })
})
```

See the [Gestures Demo](examples/gestures.html) for an example.

## FAQ

**Q: What is jQMultiTouch?**

*A: jQMultiTouch is a development framework for multi-touch web interfaces. It is based on jQuery and adopts some of its core concepts with the goal of providing a uniform method for implementing multi-device web applications with support for multi-touch interactions. This is a challenge due to the increased diversity of touch-enabled devices ranging not only from the iPhone/iPod touch and iPad to Android phones and tablets, but nowadays also including laptops and all-in-one desktop computers with support for touch input. It currently supports Firefox and WebKit-based browsers, and provides different methods for the recognotion and implementation of gesture-based interactions.*

**Q: How is it different from jQuery Mobile, jQTouch and Sencha Touch?**

*A: jQMultiTouch does not have the specific focus on mobile web application development and also does not provide UI widgets and components that mimic the look of native controls. The idea behind jQMultiTouch is to provide a general framework for multi-touch web interface development and to address some of the core challenges such as tracking multiple input points on one or more web page elements at a time, supporting multi-touch event capture and delegation and implementing custom gesture handlers.*

**Q: Can I use jQMultiTouch in my projects?**

*A: Yes, please fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/michaelnebeling/jqmultitouch) and go ahead. jQMultiTouch has been released as free open-source software distributed under the GPLv3 (GNU Public License).*

**Q: Why doesn't it work on my touch device?**

*A: We know that compatibility with some devices is still a problem (e.g. Windows Phone and Windows 8 touch devices are not yet supported), and are working on fixing the issues.*
